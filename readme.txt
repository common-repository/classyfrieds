a classifieds system / directory listing that ties in seamlessly through use of WP native functions

== Description ==
This classified system / directory listing uses genuine WP custom posts and taxonomies to create a simple to use and easily expandable classifieds or directory system. Choose or create unlimited layouts and CSS stylesheets, turn user fields on or off and so much more. Integrates well with existing plugins, widgets and wordpress core.
The classyfrieds framework was built for ease of use. Anyone can easily add on functionality; Clear comments are available throughout the code for developers. All available add-ons and extensions install simply like WP regular plugins.

= IE support =
I Truly hate IE and I think it should be banned from the internet asap, however I will do my best to maintain a minimal operational level for IE browsers. 
Supporting IE wastes a lot of my valuable time, so it's not on my list of top-10 priorities. if you have a burning issue with IE drop me a line and I'll try to make it work for you.
	
== Installation ==
install and activate the plugin. Then visit the classyfrieds page in your admin panel for some 'First Light' information
Read a bit, visit the permalink page and you're good to go.

Classyfrieds come standard with different layouts and stylesheets, you can see all standard layouts by using the SWITCH ME option over at : http://classyfrieds.com/classyfrieds/

= REQUIREMENTS =
	. Classyfrieds only works with pretty permalinks !
	. Theme design should adhere to generic WP conventions (custom code support available)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why does this plugin not show nice in my theme ? =
If your theme was written according to regular WP conventions it should look fine. See http://classyfrieds.com for a random selection of themes through our theme-switcher. However, we do get a lot of requests for commercial theme support. Some of these themes use custom headers or redirects which may hamper or even break classyfrieds. We do offer theme support through our commercial freelance activities.
= How do the categories and tags work in the classifieds =
categories in classyfrieds are separated from normal categories so they will not show in your regular post-category sections and are contained to the classifieds. Tags on the other hand are purposely mixed with your regular blog tags, so if you run a tag-cloud or other tag widget it will also show tags from your directory listings or classifieds section.

= Why is this not working for me ? =
We don't know ! We'll need some more information. Drop a line in our forums and be specific about your problem. In the meantime, try visiting the permalink settings in your admin panel, and read the first-light section inside the plugin admin UI.

= Where do I get more information ? = 
The forum over at http://classyfrieds.com/questions/ is monitored most frequently by the developers. Alternatively you could try and post on the plugin page at wordpress.org but be warned that we do not visit those forums regularly. 

= KNOWN ISSUES =
